# Real time chat app using Socket.io, Nodejs

- No database. Considering sqlite for testing. Store username and message
- Extend to make it more slack-like. Ie. @inspiration to get inspirational message, or @imageCat to get image of a cat from unsplash
- UI can be better, ie. make it more obvious who is talking. Anyone other than the current person should be in a separate column
- no react
- no tests
